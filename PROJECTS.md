## Projects
Here's a list of all the project's that I have worked on. This was last updated on 25th, November 2022.

- ### **üíö A Thing**
**Link**: [Homepage](https://athing.vercel.app/) <br/>
**Timeline**: October 2022 - Current <br/>
**Stack**:  NextJS, Typescript, Prisma (PostgreSQL), Excalidraw, Tailwind. <br/>
A Thing is a place where people can anonymously share about daily life in short notes. They can also write public/private journals and log their entries and rant about their daily lives. I wrote this Open Source project solely dedicated towards people struggling with mental health, towards people who have a lot to say but can't due to the fear of being judged. I personally use the platform and hence the need to develop it.
- ### **üôä Unreleased Project**
**Timeline**: July 2022 - Stale Development (T.B.C) <br/>
**Stack**:  MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, NodeJS, Tailwind. <br/>
Shhh...a super secret Project cooking up. More details will be revealed on my Twitter. So make sure to stay tuned.
- ### **‚ú® Project Dimensional Rift**
**Timeline**: Apr 2022 - Apr 2022 <br/>
**Link**: [Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/v8OR6uk) <br/>
**Stack**: Vanilla CSS, HTML & Powerful Library ThreeJS <br/>
Dimensional Rift was a personal portfolio project. It challenged me to incorporate 3D in a web page by exposing me to langauges such as OpenGL and GLSL Shader Language. However, the domain expired & lack of version control was the reason that the code was lost. The project screenshot's can be found here.

- ### **üí≥ AAVE Protocol Project**
**Timeline**: March 2022 - March 2022 <br/>
**Link**: [AAVE Protocol Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/aave_brownie) <br/>
**Stack**: Solidity, Python, Brownie. <br/>
This project is made to interact with AAVE in a programatic way. It does the following: Convert's ETH into WETH. Deposits WETH into AAVE. Borrow's DAI & Repay's DAI.
It stretched my wings to interact with existing Web3 Protocols such as AAVE and DAO's through their interfaces. I learned a lot about Web3 with the help of [Patrick
Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickalphac/) and his awesome work at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The code can be found [AAVE Protocol Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/aave_brownie)
- ### **üåßÔ∏è Wethics**
**Timeline**: Dec 2020 - Jan 2021 <br/>
**Link**: [So You Wanna Know The Weather](https://soyouwannaknowtheweatherhuh.vercel.app/) <br/>
**Stack**:  Django, Python, Html, CSS, Javascript <br/>
Wethics is a Weather Application devloped by me within a time-frame of 6 Days. It is based on "Python" and it's popular framework "Django". It sends a API (Application Programing Interface) call to a external service which returns the weather data based on the Location of the User which is retrieved via HTTP-Header. It then displays the data in a beautiful and representative manner. The code can be found [Wethics Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/wethics.git)
