Here's a list of all the project's that I have worked on. This was last updated on 30th, November 2022.

- ### **üíö A Thing**
**Timeline**: October 2022 - November 2022 <br/>
**Link**: [Live Demo](https://athing.vercel.app/) <br/>
**More Information**: [A Thing Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/athing) <br />
**Stack**:  NextJS, Typescript, Prisma (PostgreSQL), Excalidraw, Tailwind. <br/>
A Thing is a place where people can anonymously share about daily life in short notes. They can also write public/private journals and log their entries and rant about their daily lives. I wrote this Open Source project solely dedicated towards people struggling with mental health, towards people who have a lot to say but can't due to the fear of being judged. I personally use the platform and hence the need to develop it.
- ### **‚ú® Project Dimensional Rift**
**Timeline**: Apr 2022 - Apr 2022 <br/>
**Link**: [Live Demo](https://dimensional-rift.vercel.app/)<br />
**More Information**: [Dimensional Rift Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/dimensional_rift) <br />
**Stack**: CSS, HTML, ThreeJS and GLSL shaders <br/>
Dimensional Rift was a personal portfolio project. The goal of the project was to build a beautiful webgl experience by harvesting vanilla html, css and javascript and Three.js. This project is archived now.
- ### **üí≥ AAVE Protocol Project**
**Timeline**: March 2022 - March 2022 <br/>
**More Information**: [AAVE Protocol Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/aave_brownie) <br/>
**Stack**: Solidity, Python, Brownie. <br/>
This project is made to interact with AAVE in a programatic way. It does the following: Convert's ETH into WETH. Deposits WETH into AAVE. Borrow's DAI & Repay's DAI.
It stretched my wings to interact with existing Web3 Protocols such as AAVE and DAO's through their interfaces. I learned a lot about Web3 with the help of [Patrick
Collins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickalphac/) and his awesome work at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The code can be found [AAVE Protocol Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/aave_brownie)
- ### **üåßÔ∏è Wethics**
**Timeline**: Dec 2020 - Jan 2021 <br/>
**Link**: [Live Demo](https://soyouwannaknowtheweatherhuh.vercel.app/) <br/>
**More Information**: [Wethics Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/wethics) <br />
**Stack**:  Django, Python, Html, CSS, Javascript <br/>
Wethics is a Weather Application devloped by me within a time-frame of 6 Days. It is based on "Python" and it's popular framework "Django". It sends a API (Application Programing Interface) call to a external service which returns the weather data based on the Location of the User which is retrieved via HTTP-Header. It then displays the data in a beautiful and representative manner. The code can be found [Wethics Repository](https://github.com/is-it-ayush/wethics.git)
